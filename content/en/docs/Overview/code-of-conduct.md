## Neurodesk's Code of Conduct

Neurodesk is an open, collaborative, and globally distributed initiative dedicated to building accessible tools for neuroimaging and neuroscience research. We value the contributions of individuals from all backgrounds and are committed to cultivating a diverse, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone.

We expect all members of the Neurodesk community to engage respectfully and constructively in all interactions, both public and private. This Code of Conduct outlines our shared values, sets expectations for behavior, and describes pathways for addressing concerns.

<p style="color:#4f7b38; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em;">1. Our Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</p>

We believe that scientific progress depends on diverse perspectives, lived experiences, and equitable participation. We welcome contributors and users of all identities, including—but not limited to—those of different:

- Ethnicities, races, national origins, and cultures

- Genders and gender identities

- Sexual orientations

- Ages and life experiences

- Religions and belief systems

- Socioeconomic backgrounds

- Abilities and disabilities

- Career stages and domains of expertise

We acknowledge that structural inequities exist in science and technology, and we commit to proactively addressing these barriers within our community. This entails recognizing preferred titles and pronouns and maintaining a respectful tone. Although we don't expect Neurodesk community members to be familiar with the cultural customs of all ethnic and cultural groups, we do expect them to acknowledge and respect the diversity within our community. This involves being willing to learn from others, share knowledge, and educate oneself.


<p style="color:#4f7b38; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em;">2. Our Shared Values</p>

We ask all members of the Neurodesk community to uphold the following values:

- **Respect**: Treat everyone with dignity and professionalism. Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior or speech.

- **Inclusion**: Actively seek to make the community accessible and inclusive. Be mindful of power dynamics, language barriers, and cultural differences.

- **Collaboration**: Foster a spirit of openness and cooperation. Value diverse perspectives, acknowledge contributions, and aim for shared success.

- **Integrity**: Be transparent, honest, and accountable. Uphold scientific and professional standards in your work and communication.

- **Responsibility**: Speak up if you witness behaviour that violates this Code. Offer support when others raise concerns, and be willing to learn and grow.

<p style="color:#4f7b38; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em;">3. Our Standards</p>

Examples of **expected behaviours** that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of **unacceptable behaviour** include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment and microagressions* 
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Abuse of position, power, or influence
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting, including scientific misconduct, such as plagiarism or data falsification

These behaviors are not tolerated under any circumstances and may result in removal from community spaces or other consequences.

{{< alert title="<span style='font-size:1.1rem;'>Microaggressions</span>" color="info" >}}
Incidents can take the form of “microaggressions,” which is a damaging form of harassment. Microaggressions are the everyday slights or insults which communicate negative messages to target individuals, often based upon their marginalized group membership. The [micropedia of microaggression](https://www.themicropedia.org/) is an excellent resource to learn more on the may forms microaggression can take (see some examples in the note below). Over time, microagressions can take a great toll on mental and emotional health, and the target’s feeling of belonging in science and academia.

The following examples can all be labelled micro-aggressions:

- commenting on a woman’s appearance rather than her work;
- only directing questions at male colleagues when there are female experts in the room;
- telling someone of colour that they “speak such good English”;
- forcefully praising meat to an individual with a vegetarian diet;
- praising alcoholic drinks to an individual who do not consume them.
- exclusion from a group can be a common nonverbal form of microaggression.
- microaggressions can be couched in the form of a “compliment,” (e.g. “you’re too attractive to be a scientist”).

<p style="color:#4f7b38; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em;">4. Reporting and Enforcement</p>

**Enforcement Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.


**Enforcement**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [mail.neurodesk@gmail.com](mailto:mail.neurodesk@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.  We do not tolerate retaliation against individuals who raise concerns in good faith.

Violations of this Code of Conduct may also be reported in confidence to one of the designated contact persons below:

Alternatively, individuals affiliated with the University of Queensland may choose to report concerns via the [official UQ complaints and appeals process](https://www.uq.edu.au/complaints-appeals/).

**Enforcement Guidelines**

Violations may result in a range of actions, including warnings, temporary or permanent removal from Neurodesk platforms or events, or notification of institutional authorities where appropriate.
