# Neurodesk website

Source for [neurodesk.org](https://neurodesk.org), built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and
[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build).

The deployed site combines:

| Path | Source |
| --- | --- |
| [Main website](https://neurodesk.org/) | [`neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io`](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io) |
| [`/edu/`](https://neurodesk.org/edu/) | [`neurodesk/neurodeskedu`](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodeskedu) |
| [`/neurocontainers-ui/`](https://neurodesk.org/neurocontainers-ui/) | [`neurodesk/neurocontainers-ui`](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurocontainers-ui) |

## Local development

You need [Node.js 22.12 or newer](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm 11](https://pnpm.io/installation).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io.git
cd neurodesk.github.io
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321). Before opening a pull request, check the build:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

`pnpm build` only builds this repository. [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io/actions)
assembles the other sections for deployment.

## Preview and deployment

Run [**Promote to Production**](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io/actions/workflows/promote-to-prod.yml)
manually in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io/actions):

- `publish: false` builds the full site and deploys it to
  [neurodesk.github.io](https://neurodesk.github.io) for testing.
- `publish: true` deploys the same build to [neurodesk.org](https://neurodesk.org) through the
  [`neurodesk.org`](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesk.org) repository.

Do not edit the generated [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesk.github.io/tree/gh-pages)
or production [`site`](https://github.com/neurodesk/neurodesk.org/tree/site) branches directly.
